CoyneCoin is an ERC20 token on the Polygon network 100% backed by the Tether stable coin. When someone sends the CoyneCoin contract MATIC, it is converted to Tether using UniSwap. The resulting Tether is held by the CoyneCoin contract and an amount of CoyneCoin is transferred to the sender. If CoyneCoin is returned to the contract, Tether is returned to the sender. Some other features of CoyneCoin are:

- On any transfer/redemption, 0.1% of the value is deposited back into the contract. This makes CoyneCoin more valuable on every transaction because there is 0.1% less in circulation but yet the same amount of Tether backing it.
- There is a redeem rate that is calculated according to what is in circulation and the amount of Tether backing it. This allows you to always purchase or redeem for the current rate.
- The nature of CoyneCoin is to increase in value steadily according to the amount transferred. The more transfers, the more it increases. It was designed to not be volatile, steadily increase over time and always allow to be redeemed for a stable currency.
