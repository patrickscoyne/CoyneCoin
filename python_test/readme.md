This is a Python script to test the CoyneCoin smart contract and track the rate changes. I used Ganache-cli to fork the Polygon blockchain and then ran 2000 random function calls from 10 different accounts selected randomly. Each account was funded with 100 MATIC. The public and private keys were parsed from add_pubs.txt and add_privs.txt so that you can just copy and paste those keys from the Ganache terminal into those files. You can of course use as many accounts as you'd like or fund them with different amounts. The results were stored in ratedata.txt.
